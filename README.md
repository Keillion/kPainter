 - It is designed for mobile first, but now it support most H5 PC browser as well. (I test firefox, chrome and edge. IE11 and safair should be test but I don't have them.)
 - Since sample/index.html has cross-origin problem in htmlpreview.github.io, I show the version with no sample img. 
 - Run sample at <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Keillion/kPainter-JS/blob/master/sample/noImg.html" target="_blank">/sample/noImg.html</a>
 - Run sample in the latest firefox PC browser, and click the QR icon at the right of address bar, you could get a QRCode which allowed mobile visit the sample easier.
