 - It is designed for mobile first, but now it support most H5 PC browser as well.
 - Since sample/index.html has cross-origin problem in htmlpreview.github.io, I show the version with no sample img. 
 - Run sample at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Keillion/kPainter-JS/blob/master/sample/noImg.html
 - Run sample in the latest firefox PC browser, and at right of address bar, you could get 2d Code which allowed mobile visit the sample easier.
